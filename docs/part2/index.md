# Architectural Responsibilities: Effective Architectural Design and Leadership

1. **Understand the Business Context**: Architects should have a deep understanding of the business domain, business problems, goals, and industry trends to design effective architectures.

2. **Act as a Bridge**: Architects must serve as a bridge between business and technology communities, merging different perspectives and expectations to create a cohesive vision.

3. **Speak the Right Language**: Be proficient in the languages used by business stakeholders, testers, and programmers to facilitate clear communication and understanding.

4. **Prioritize Human Factors**: Consider the human aspect in architecture, including listening to stakeholders' pain points and addressing them in your design.

5. **Be Hands-On**: If you design it, you should be capable of coding it. Understand the effort required to implement each design element to avoid unrealistic expectations and risks.

6. **Check Your Ego**: Avoid letting ego drive your decisions; the architecture should be driven by requirements and collaborative input from the team.

7. **Apply Common Sense**: Use common sense, built through experience and education, as a guiding principle in creating practical and effective architectures.

# Be Hands-On: The Importance of Coding What You Design

In the world of software and systems architecture, the phrase "if you design it, you should be capable of coding it" carries significant weight. This concept underscores the importance of architects being deeply engaged in the practical aspects of their designs. Being hands-on, or having the ability to code what you design, ensures that your architectural decisions are grounded in reality, thereby avoiding unrealistic expectations and mitigating risks. This approach not only strengthens the architect’s understanding of the systems they design but also fosters better collaboration with development teams and ultimately leads to more successful project outcomes.

## Why Being Hands-On Matters

1. **Ensuring Feasibility**:
   One of the most compelling reasons for architects to be hands-on is to ensure that their designs are feasible. A design that looks great on paper may be impractical or inefficient when it comes to actual implementation. By being capable of coding the designs they create, architects can better evaluate the practicality of their ideas. They can foresee potential challenges, assess whether certain elements are overly complex or resource-intensive, and make informed decisions about which technologies and approaches will work best.

2. **Bridging the Gap Between Design and Implementation**:
   The divide between design and implementation can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and even failures in projects. When architects are also capable coders, they can bridge this gap more effectively. They understand the intricacies of coding, the limitations of certain technologies, and the effort required to implement various components. This knowledge allows them to create designs that are not only visionary but also executable within the given constraints of time, budget, and resources.

3. **Improving Communication with Development Teams**:
   Architects who are hands-on have a unique advantage when it comes to communicating with development teams. They speak the same language as the developers, which fosters better collaboration and understanding. When architects can explain their designs in terms of actual code, they gain the trust and respect of the development team. This mutual understanding helps to ensure that the implementation aligns closely with the original design, reducing the risk of deviations or misinterpretations.

4. **Reducing Risks and Avoiding Unrealistic Expectations**:
   Unrealistic expectations can be a major risk in any project. When architects are disconnected from the implementation process, they may inadvertently set goals or timelines that are unattainable. By being hands-on and understanding the effort required to implement each design element, architects can set more realistic expectations for the project. This approach minimizes the risk of scope creep, budget overruns, and missed deadlines, leading to more successful project outcomes.

## Strategies for Being a Hands-On Architect

1. **Stay Involved in Coding**:
   Even if coding is not your primary responsibility, make an effort to stay involved in the coding process. This could mean writing code for specific components, participating in code reviews, or even developing prototypes to test the feasibility of your designs. Regularly engaging with code keeps your skills sharp and ensures that you remain grounded in the practical realities of software development.

2. **Collaborate Closely with Developers**:
   Work closely with the development team throughout the project lifecycle. Participate in daily stand-ups, pair programming sessions, or technical discussions. By maintaining a close connection with the developers, you can provide guidance, answer questions, and make adjustments to the design as needed. This collaborative approach ensures that the project stays on track and that the design is implemented as intended.

3. **Understand the Technology Stack**:
   Familiarize yourself with the technology stack being used in the project. This includes understanding the programming languages, frameworks, databases, and other tools that are integral to the system. By knowing the strengths and limitations of these technologies, you can make more informed design decisions and better anticipate potential challenges during implementation.

4. **Prototype Critical Components**:
   For particularly complex or novel design elements, consider creating prototypes to validate your ideas. Prototyping allows you to test the feasibility of a design before committing to it fully. This hands-on approach helps to identify potential issues early in the process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant resources are invested.

5. **Continuously Learn and Update Skills**:
   Technology is constantly evolving, and staying current with the latest trends, tools, and best practices is essential for any architect. Dedicate time to continuous learning, whether through online courses, workshops, or self-directed study. Keeping your skills up-to-date ensures that your designs are relevant and that you can effectively contribute to the implementation process.

6. **Engage in Code Reviews and Technical Discussions**:
   Participate in code reviews and technical discussions within the development team. This involvement allows you to see how your designs are being translated into code and to provide feedback or clarification where needed. It also helps you stay informed about any technical challenges that may arise, enabling you to address them proactively.

## The Benefits of Being a Hands-On Architect

The hands-on approach offers numerous benefits, both for the architect and the overall success of the project:

- **Increased Design Accuracy**: When architects are involved in coding, their designs are more likely to be accurate and aligned with what is technically feasible. This reduces the likelihood of costly redesigns or implementation challenges later in the project.

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Hands-on architects foster better collaboration between design and development teams. This collaborative environment leads to smoother project execution and a stronger alignment between design and implementation.

- **Greater Project Success**: By understanding the effort required to implement each design element, architects can set realistic expectations and mitigate risks. This leads to more successful projects, with fewer delays, budget overruns, or technical issues.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Staying engaged with the coding process allows architects to learn from each project and continuously improve their designs. This iterative approach leads to better outcomes over time and helps architects develop more effective and innovative solutions.

- **Professional Growth**: For architects, maintaining hands-on coding skills contributes to professional growth and development. It ensures that you remain a valuable and relevant contributor to your team and that your skills stay sharp in an ever-evolving field.

## Conclusion: The Value of Hands-On Involvement

In the world of architecture, being hands-on is not just a nice-to-have; it’s a crucial aspect of creating effective and realistic designs. When architects are capable of coding what they design, they bridge the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that their designs are both visionary and executable. This approach reduces risks, fosters better collaboration, and ultimately leads to more successful projects.

By staying engaged in the coding process, architects gain a deeper understanding of the technologies they work with, build stronger relationships with development teams, and create designs that truly meet the needs of the business. So, embrace the hands-on approach—code what you design, understand the effort required, and watch your architectural visions come to life in the most practical and effective ways possible.

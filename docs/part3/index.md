# Suggestions for Recruiting and Managing Development Teams

1. **Prioritize Problem-Solving Skills**: Look for developers who are passionate about problem-solving and can tackle issues regardless of the technology involved.

2. **Assess Problem-Solving Methods**: During interviews, ask candidates to explain their approach to diagnosing a performance problem. This will provide insights into their problem-solving process.

3. **Evaluate Learning from Experience**: Ask candidates what they would change if they could start their most recent project anew. This question helps assess their ability to apply lessons learned from past experiences.

4. **Understand Team Dynamics**: Ensure that as an architect, you recognize the different personalities and skills within your team (e.g., "dwarves," "elves," "wizards") and design roles in the architecture that suit all team members.

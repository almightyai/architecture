# KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

1. **Solve the Specific Problem:** Focus on addressing the exact problem at hand. Avoid overdesigning and adding unnecessary complexity to your solutions.

2. **Build the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work:** Understand the real need, break down the problem into manageable parts, prioritize effectively, and deliver results as quickly as possible.

3. **Avoid Cleverness:** Clever software tends to be expensive, difficult to maintain, and prone to failure. Opt for simple, "dumb" solutions that are easier to implement and maintain.

4. **Aim for “Good Enough”:** Strive for a solution that is "good enough" rather than perfect. Over-engineering leads to unnecessary complexity and should be avoided.

5. **Beware of Over-Engineering:** Over-engineering at the architectural level introduces significant challenges. Keep designs simple to avoid compounding issues.

6. **Keep It Simple and Avoid Over-Complication:** Avoid adding unnecessary complexity to your design. Stick to straightforward solutions that are easy to understand and maintain, reducing the risk of confusion and maintenance difficulties later on.

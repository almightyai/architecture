# Project Management for Architects

- **Acknowledge Early Warnings**: Pay attention when team members identify potential issues early on, and address them instead of dismissing or ignoring them.

- **Track Risks Like Bugs**: Monitor and track risks just as you would track bugs. Regularly review and prioritize risks, especially when new information becomes available.

- **Take Ownership of Project Quality**: As the architect, take responsibility for the overall quality of the project and its successful delivery to the business, rather than leaving this solely to the project manager.

- **Adapt Timelines Flexibly**: If the original timeline becomes unfeasible, consider deferring non-critical functionality to future releases to maintain project momentum.

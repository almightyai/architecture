# Managing Requirements

1. **Focus on Intended Value:** When assessing a requested feature, ask about its intended value to address the real underlying problem rather than accepting the customer's proposed solution.

2. **Quantify Requirements:** Avoid vague adjectives like "fast" or "flexible." Instead, quantify requirements by specifying details such as quantity, frequency, speed, growth rate, and timeline.

3. **Prioritize Key Requirements:** Identify and focus on the most valuable requirement, ensuring it drives the architecture.

4. **Solid Foundations:** Ensure that the facts and assumptions underpinning your software are robust, as they are crucial to the system's foundation.

5. **Balance Needs:** Balance technical requirements with the business needs of stakeholders, considering aspects like security, usability, and supportability.

6. **Customer Success:** Design with the understanding that if your customer’s customer succeeds, your customer succeeds too.

7. **Refine Thought:** Continuously refine your understanding of requirements, distilling them to their essence. Test each requirement by questioning its consistency across all situations.

8. **Simplify Scope:** Simplifying project scope can lead to a simpler architecture, which increases the likelihood of success.

9. **Understand Business Value:** An architect must understand the software’s value to the business, including its return on investment (ROI).

10. **Appropriate Solutions:** Choose technologies and solutions that best meet the requirements, rather than selecting based on personal preferences.

# Stakeholders: Key Suggestions for Architects

- **Be a Negotiator**: When discussing cost-cutting related to technology choices, prioritize negotiation skills to find balanced solutions.

- **Monitor and Mitigate Acceptance Risks**: Focus on addressing and mitigating the risk of sustained negative reactions to new systems by understanding and managing user concerns.

- **Engage End Users Early**: Start discussions with end users early to communicate the benefits and address concerns. Use system design, training, demonstrations, and knowledge sharing to build acceptance.

- **Build a Strong Business Case**: Establish a clear value proposition for your architecture, quantifying its benefits with metrics and linking them to traditional business measures. Know when to stop and find the right timing for discussions.

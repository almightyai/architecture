# Focus on Intended Value: A Crucial Perspective for Architects

In the realm of software architecture, understanding and addressing the true needs of stakeholders is essential. As architects, we are often presented with specific feature requests from customers or stakeholders. These requests are typically accompanied by their proposed solutions—how they believe the feature should be implemented. However, a key skill that separates an effective architect from a merely competent one is the ability to dig deeper and focus on the intended value of these requests. This approach not only leads to better outcomes but also ensures that the architecture remains aligned with the true needs of the business.

## Understanding the "Why" Behind the Request

When a customer asks for a specific feature, it's easy to jump straight into thinking about how to implement it. But before diving into the "how," it's crucial to first understand the "why." What problem is the customer trying to solve with this feature? What value do they expect it to deliver? By focusing on the intended value, architects can uncover the real underlying problems that need to be addressed, which may not always align with the customer’s initial solution.

For example, a customer might request a complex reporting feature that they believe will help them track business performance more effectively. Instead of simply accepting this request and starting to design the feature, an architect should ask questions like, "What specific performance metrics are most important to your business?" and "How will this report be used to make decisions?" These questions can reveal that the real need might be for more straightforward, real-time data dashboards rather than a traditional report, which could be more beneficial and less costly to implement.

## The Risks of Accepting Proposed Solutions at Face Value

Accepting a customer’s proposed solution without questioning it can lead to several risks:

1. **Misalignment with Business Goals:** The proposed solution might not align with the broader business objectives, leading to wasted resources on features that don’t deliver real value.
   
2. **Overcomplication:** Customers might suggest overly complex solutions that address symptoms rather than root causes. This can result in an architecture that is difficult to maintain, scale, or adapt in the future.

3. **Missed Opportunities for Innovation:** By focusing on the intended value rather than the proposed solution, architects can identify more innovative or efficient ways to achieve the desired outcome.

## Strategies for Focusing on Intended Value

To effectively focus on intended value, architects should consider adopting the following strategies:

1. **Ask Probing Questions:** When a feature is requested, ask questions to understand the broader context and the problem the feature is intended to solve. For instance, "What are the main challenges you’re currently facing?" or "How will this feature improve your current workflow?"

2. **Engage in Dialogue:** Instead of just taking requirements at face value, engage in a dialogue with stakeholders. This helps clarify their needs and can often lead to a better understanding of what they truly require.

3. **Prioritize Business Outcomes:** Always tie feature requests back to business outcomes. If a feature doesn’t clearly contribute to a significant business goal, it might be worth reconsidering its implementation or looking for alternative solutions.

4. **Use Scenarios and Use Cases:** Develop scenarios or use cases that illustrate how the requested feature will deliver value in real-world situations. This can help validate the feature’s relevance and identify potential improvements.

5. **Educate Stakeholders:** Sometimes, stakeholders might not fully understand the technical implications of their requests. Educating them about the potential challenges and alternative approaches can lead to more informed decisions and better outcomes.

## Realizing the Benefits

Focusing on intended value has several benefits for both architects and their stakeholders:

- **Alignment with Business Needs:** By addressing the real underlying problems, the architecture is more likely to meet the actual needs of the business, leading to better overall outcomes.
  
- **Efficiency and Effectiveness:** Solutions are more likely to be right-sized and fit-for-purpose, avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing resources where they matter most.

- **Increased Stakeholder Satisfaction:** When stakeholders see that their true needs are being met, they are more likely to be satisfied with the final product, which builds trust and strengthens relationships.

- **Flexibility and Future-Proofing:** Solutions that focus on intended value rather than specific implementations are often more flexible and adaptable, making them easier to evolve as business needs change.

## Conclusion

As architects, it is our responsibility to ensure that the systems we design and build truly serve the needs of the business. By focusing on the intended value of feature requests, we can move beyond simply implementing solutions to addressing the real problems our customers face. This approach not only leads to better architectural outcomes but also ensures that our work is aligned with the broader goals of the organization, delivering lasting value over time.
